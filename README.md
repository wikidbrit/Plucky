Remember that this is a company website and getting users is crucial. The company might be selling a product, a service or growing a community. 

Good things to consider are:

Loading times
Creating trust
Removing clutter
CTA-buttons
Clear navigation
Make a user follow a journey
Time & planning
You will have 1 1/2 half day to ask questions and get all the answers from your friend about their "Passion company". Plan & explore and build (code) the website.

You will be presenting your friends company website on Thursday at 11:00.

Ps, do not show each other the company websites you made for yourselves. This is a "listening - planning -designing" workshop. 

Good luck ðŸ™Œ

My partner is Linnea and her company idea is around the idea of what Netflix used to be, but for boardgames. Users signup for a subscription and list the games they want to try, and the company sends out the game for them to try with their friends and family.

I came up with the name Plucky and designed an original logo for the project along with the UI in Figma. This was a real challenge as I departed her original inspiration for something I felt was a better reflection of the brand. She suggested something very professional but also had the requirement of fun. I didnt feel the sites she sent really expressed that emotion in their designs. However some elements I attempted to adopt. Including a type focused logo, light colors, and a playful feeling. 

Once the design was finished I started coding the landing page. 

I hope so likes it.
